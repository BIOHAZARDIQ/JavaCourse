# JavaCourse
Project for JAVA learning purposes. 
Contains most used code constructs in one simple playground, that can be used to learn JAVA code principles.
Each package in class contains some JAVA principle with comments that can be used for learning purposes.


## Installation
1. Install an IDE (Recommended: IntelliJ IDEA)
1. Install Java
1. Clone git repository of this project to your local drive
1. Open file *pom.xml* as a Idea Project and wait until maven plugins are downloaded
1. Build whole project
1. Download ChromeDriver WebDriver from *https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads* (or WebDriver for your preferred browser)
1. Edit path of downloaded webdriver in file *settings.properties*
1. Run desired JAVA stuff:
	- Choose desired class of project and run it (example: *src/main/java/org/syntax/Loops.java*) by right clicking on class name and selecting *run*
	- Run whole test package directly from *testng.xml* file by right clicking on it from your IDE and selecting *run*


## Usage
Each functionality is divided a to different packages, that can be run separately from IntelliJ Idea for example.

- **streams**        - concept of Java Streams
- **syntax**         - concept of Java syntax
- **selenium**       - concept of Java Selenium framework used for UI testing
- **testng**         - concept of Java TestNG framework used for testing
- **apitesting**     - concept of Java API testing with RestAssured framework
- **cucumber**       - concept of Behaviour Driven Development framework *cucumber* used for testing
- **company**        - simple programs


## Recommended learning path:
1. Start with Java keywords in file *JavaKeywordsEnum.java*
1. Continue with classes in package *syntax* (all of them are runnable)
1. Continue with classes in package *packages*
1. Continue with classes in package *inheritance*
1. Continue with classes in package *abstraction*
1. For advanced Java, continue with classes in package *streams*
1. For UI testing, continue with classes in package *selenium*
1. For UI testing patterns, continue with classes in package *designpatterns*
1. For UI testing frameworks, continue with classes in packages *testng* and *cucumber*
1. For API testing, continue with classes in package *apitesting*
