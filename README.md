# JavaCourse
Project for JAVA learning purposes. 
Contains most used code constructs in one simple playground, that can be used to learn JAVA code principles.
Each package in class contains some JAVA principle with comments that can be used for learning purposes.


## Installation
1. Install an IDE (Recommended: IntelliJ IDEA)
1. Install Java JDK (Download from: https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads)
1. Clone git repository of this project to your local drive (or download it as zip archive)

   - download ChromeDriver WebDriver from *https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads* (or WebDriver for your preferred browser)
   - edit path of downloaded webdriver in file *settings.properties*
1. Run desired JAVA stuff
	- choose desired class of project and run it (example: *src/main/java/org/syntax/Loops.java*) by right clicking on class name and selecting *run*
	- run whole test package directly from *testng.xml* file by right clicking on it from your IDE and selecting *run*


## Usage
Each functionality is divided a to different packages, that can be run separately from IntelliJ Idea for example.
